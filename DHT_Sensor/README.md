# This project reads from a Digital humidity temperature sensor of type (DHT11/21/22)
# BCM NATIVE HARDWARE NUMBERING is used FOR Setupmode.
# WiringPi library from Gordon Henderson is used to read the pulses from the sensor and set the pins
# WiringPi is an open source library
# Root mode should be enabled to get reading from sensor
